Takes two values (they can be numbers or strings).
Compares them using the === operator.
If they are equal and of the same type, print "Same value and type".
If they have the same value but different types, print "Same value but different type".
Otherwise, print "Different values".


Takes a number as input.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If it's only divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If it's only divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
Otherwise, print "Not divisible by 3 or 5".
Use the ternary operator to solve this.
