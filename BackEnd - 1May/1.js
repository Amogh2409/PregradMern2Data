// Node JS - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine



// v8- engine - JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome and Node.js
// Nodejs - contains a built-in library of modules that provide various functionalities, such as file system access, HTTP server creation, and more. These modules can be used to build server-side applications and perform tasks like reading and writing files, handling network requests, and interacting with databases.

// FAST I/O OPERATIONS - Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently, allowing developers to build scalable applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections without blocking the event loop.

// EVENT LOOP - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The event loop allows Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without creating new threads for each request, which helps in achieving high performance and scalability.


// npm - package manager - a tool that allows developers to install, manage, and share packages (libraries or modules) for Node.js applications. It is included with Node.js installations and provides a command-line interface for managing dependencies.





// node js can be used for various purposes, including:
// Node.js can generate dynamic page content
// Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
// Node.js can collect form data
// Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
