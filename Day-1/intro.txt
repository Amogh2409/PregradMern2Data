Express JS - Backend framework
"Express.js is a lightweight and fast Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs."

form - details - submit -> upload - db

Netflix - movie - db via api (movie)

fetch('http://localhost:5000/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));




React (Frontend) sends a request to the backend.

Express (Backend) receives the request and interacts with MongoDB.

MongoDB fetches or stores data and sends a response.

Express processes the response and sends it back to React.

React updates the UI based on the response.
